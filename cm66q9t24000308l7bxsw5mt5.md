## Introduction

When building applications, we interact with a lot of data. As backend developers, we need to learn how to manage our data and ensure that clients can fetch the data they want, no matter how large. Pagination is one of the ways we can achieve this.  
Pagination refers to dividing content into smaller/discrete pages. Pagination can also be referred to as *paging.*

## How does pagination improve our websites?

1. It gives our pages direction and structure.
    
2. When we don't paginate, we overwhelm the user with scrolling.
    
3. Continuous scrolling might result in text being hastily skimmed rather than thoroughly read. Pagination encourages users to make tiny commitments at regular intervals (clicking to the next page), which can improve retention and engagement.
    
4. Pagination helps users remember where they left off. If a user is on the fifth page of a blog, they may quickly return to where they left off, which is not as simple with endless scrolling.
    

In this article, we will be implementing pagination in our `express.js` application using a relational database (Postgres); in the next series, we will use a non-relational database (MongoDB), and the next we’ll see if we can do this same operation in `Nestjs`.

## How Pagination works

Pagination is a technique for dividing huge datasets into smaller, more manageable parts. This is critical for optimizing the speed and user experience of programs that must show or process massive volumes of data. Here is an in-depth look at how pagination works:

### The pagination process

The pagination process undergoes the following steps:

* User Request: The client requests a specific page by sending a page number via a query or parameter. The client can also request the limit, which means the number of items that should be displayed per page. Some other parameters that can be passed by the client are the filter parameters, this would filter our responses based on the passed parameters. The client can also attach the date range to the request. The date range ensures that the queried data is between the specified dates.
    
* Data fetching: With these in place, the data is fetched from the database and the response is constructed to return the requested data
    

### Parameters in pagination

* **Pagination**: This is the breaking down of large data into small chunks. For example, our user database has a lot of users—over 5000 users. But we know that to fetch and display this data, it would be a large task. So when fetching the data, we decided to break it into smaller chunks. To achieve this, we need to know the following to make our work easier:
    
* **Page Size/Limit**: This gives us the number of items displayed per page (or chunk of data fetched).
    
* **Page Number**: This information gives the current page.
    
* **Total Page**: This gives the number of pages that the fetched data has been split into.
    
* **Total Count**: This gives the total count of items items that exist in the database
    
* **Offset**: This is an internal calculation used to determine the starting point for the data to be fetched. It is calculated as follows:`(page - 1) * limit`
    

> In this article we will be exploring pagination in express app, using Sequelize as our ORM to communicate with our relational database. Next series we will be try NoSQL databases.

### How to paginate in an express application using `sequelize` for a relational database

To start this simple project, let's start by cloning our boilerplate code from this repo

```bash
# Create a folder for our project
mkdir pagination

# navigate into it and clone the repo into a relational-db folder
git clone https://github.com/nwokporochukwuebuka/express-sequlize.git relational-db

# navigate into the relational-db directory
cd relational-db

# install all the necessary dependencies
npm install
```

After installing, you should have a folder structure of this sort

```bash
└── relational-db
    └── .env
    └── .gitignore
    └── Makefile
    └── package-lock.json
    └── package.json
    └── readme.md
    └── src
        └── app.js
        └── config
            └── config.js
        └── controllers
            └── user.controller.js
        └── index.js
        └── middlewares
            └── error.js
            └── validate.js
        └── models
            └── index.js
            └── user.model.js
        └── routers
            └── v1
                └── index.js
                └── user.route.js
        └── services
            └── user.service.js
        └── utils
            └── ApiError.js
            └── catchAsync.js
            └── pick.js
        └── validations
```

Please don't forget to add your `.env` file to run your project and also update your Makefile with these variables. The purpose was to help us run Postgres using Docker.

When fetching paginated data, some fields are

Now, to the task at hand: Now in our `utils` folder, create a file called `query-helper.js`

```bash
touch ./src/utils/query-helper.js
```

Inside the `query-helper.js` file, let's paste the following line of code

```javascript
const { Op } = require("sequelize");

const getPaginatedData = async (
  model,
  {
    page = 1,
    limit = 10,
    sortField = "createdAt",
    sortOrder = "DESC",
    filters = {},
    dateField = "createdAt",
    startDate,
    endDate,
    include = [],
  }
) => {
  // This tells us where the data should be fetched from
  const offset = (page - 1) * limit;

  // incase we have filters, 
  const where = {};

  // This caters for filters that have multiple values e.g status = active or inactive
  Object.keys(filters).forEach((key) => {
    if (Array.isArray(filters[key])) {
      where[key] = {
        [Op.or]: filters[key],
      };
    } else {
      where[key] = filters[key];
    }
  });

  // Caters for date range
  if (startDate && endDate) {
    where[dateField] = {
      [Op.between]: [new Date(startDate), new Date(endDate)],
    };
  } else if (startDate) {
    where[dateField] = {
      [Op.gte]: new Date(startDate),
    };
  } else if (endDate) {
    where[dateField] = {
      [Op.lte]: new Date(endDate),
    };
  }

  if (include.length > 0) {
    const { count, rows } = await model.findAndCountAll({
      where,
      order: [[sortField, sortOrder]],
      limit,
      offset,
      include,
    });
    return {
      totalItems: count,
      totalPages: Math.ceil(count / limit),
      currentPage: page,
      limit,
      data: rows,
    };
  }
  // Fetch data with pagination, sorting, and filtering
  const { count, rows } = await model.findAndCountAll({
    where,
    order: [[sortField, sortOrder]],
    limit,
    offset,
  });
  return {
    totalItems: count,
    totalPages: Math.ceil(count / limit),
    currentPage: page,
    limit,
    data: rows,
  };
};

module.exports = {
  getPaginatedData,
};
```

Now let's take the function bit by bit to understand properly,

**Import Function and Definition**

```javascript
const { Op } = require("sequelize");
```

The [`Op`](https://sequelize.org/docs/v6/core-concepts/model-querying-basics/#operators) function is a function that contains most `sequelize` comparison operators. Here are some comparison operators: `$gt`,`$gte`,`$lt`,`$lte`,`$or`,`$eq`,`$like`,`$not`,`$is`,`$ne`, etc.

```javascript
const getPaginatedData = async (
  model,
  {
    page = 1,
    limit = 10,
    sortField = "createdAt",
    sortOrder = "DESC",
    filters = {},
    dateField = "createdAt",
    startDate,
    endDate,
    include = [],
  }
) => {
  // body
};
```

* `model`This parameter represents the `sequelize` parameter to query.
    
* `page`This supplies the page number that should be queried; it defaults to `1` if not supplied by the client.
    
* `limit`This gives the number of records per page; if not provided, it defaults to.`10`
    
* `sortField`This is the field to sort the results by; for databases created with Sequelize, we love to use the `createdAt` field.
    
* `sortOrder`This parameter specifies the order of sorting this result in descending or ascending order. default is,`DESC` which represents descending order. To use ascending order, we pass.`ASC`
    
* `filters`This is an object containing the filter criteria. We could decide to filter based on different fields in our table; e.g., in the `status` field, a user can either be`activeinactive`, or.`suspended` If we want to filter based on this status, then we pass it into our filter, so our filter will be
    
    ```javascript
    filter = {
        status: "active"
    }
    ```
    
    In this example, our filter is just a single value, i.e., we want to fetch users with an active status. If we also want to fetch users that are either `active` or,`inactive` here is how we go about it:
    
    ```javascript
    filter = {
        status: ["active", "inactive"]
    }
    ```
    
* `dateField`This parameter tells us which field we will use for the date range filter. The default field is usually `createdAt`
    
* `startDate`This`endDate` is the passed start and end date for the date range.
    
* `include`This represents the array of models associated with the query. This is useful when there is an association between models and we want to fetch the related model.
    

Unto the next,

**Calculate**`offset`

`offset`determines the starting point for fetching the records. Here is how we calculate the offset:

```javascript
const offset = (page -1) * limit
```

**Handle**`filters`

```javascript
const where = {};

Object.keys(filters).forEach((key) => {
  if (Array.isArray(filters[key])) {
    where[key] = {
      [Op.or]: filters[key],
    };
  } else {
    where[key] = filters[key];
  }
});
```

This handles the filter based on a certain field. The `where` variable holds the condition for the query.

When a filtered value has more than one possibility, e.g when the query should fetch both `active` or `inactive` users, our filter would be

```javascript
filters = {
    status: ['active', 'inactive'],
}
```

This would check if the supplied filter contains an array, and if yes, the `Op.or` operator is used to query the database.

For a single filter condition, e.g for only active users, our filter would be

```javascript
filter = {
    status: 'active',
}
```

---

*PS: You can have multiple fields in your filter object. e.g*

```javascript
filter = {
    status: 'active',
    firstName: 'Eyilademi',
    lastName: 'Chukwuebuka',
}
```

---

**Handle Date Range**

```javascript
if (startDate && endDate) {
    where[dateField] = {
      [Op.between]: [new Date(startDate), new Date(endDate)],
    };
  } else if (startDate) {
    where[dateField] = {
      [Op.gte]: new Date(startDate),
    };
  } else if (endDate) {
    where[dateField] = {
      [Op.lte]: new Date(endDate),
    };
  }
```

This handles the date range, so when the `startDate` and `endDate` the field is submitted to the,`dateField` which is `createdAt` by default given a value to search between using the sequelize `Op.between` operator, meaning that the data provided will be greater than the `startDate` but less than the.`endDate` If only the `startDate` is provided, then the queried data must have dates that are greater than the.`startDate` Likewise, if only`endDate` the queried data should have data provided `dateField` is less than the`endDate`

**Querying with**`include`

```javascript
if (include.length > 0) {
  const { count, rows } = await model.findAndCountAll({
    where,
    order: [[sortField, sortOrder]],
    limit,
    offset,
    include,
  });
  return {
    totalItems: count,
    totalPages: Math.ceil(count / limit),
    currentPage: page,
    limit,
    data: rows,
  };
}
```

This option allows for eager loading. This addresses fetching associated models at once; you can read more on the [Sequelize website](https://sequelize.org/docs/v6/advanced-association-concepts/eager-loading/#multiple-eager-loading).

The data is queried with the specified parameter if the `include` function is not specified.

Next, we update the`user.service.js`,`user.controller.js`file:

```javascript
// ....
const queryUsers = async (
  page,
  limit,
  sortField,
  sortOrder,
  startDate,
  endDate,
  filters
) =>
  await getPaginatedData(db.users, {
    page: parseInt(page === undefined ? page : 1, 10),
    limit: parseInt(limit === undefined ? limit : 10, 10),
    sortField: sortField || "createdAt",
    sortOrder: sortOrder || "DESC",
    dateField: "createdAt",
    filters,
    startDate,
    endDate,
  });

module.exports = {
    // ...,
    queryUsers,
}
```

`user.controller.js`

```javascript
// ....
const getUsers = catchAsync(async (req, res) => {
  const { page, limit, startDate, endDate, status, firstName, lastName, sortField, sortBy } =
    req.query;

  const filters = {};

  if (status) {
    filters.status = status;
  }

  if (firstName) {
    filters.firstName = firstName;
  }

  if (lastName) {
    filters.lastName = lastName;
  }
  const users = await userService.queryUsers(
    page,
    limit,
    sortField || "createdAt",
    sortBy || "DESC",
    startDate,
    endDate,
    filters
  );
  return res.status(httpStatus.OK).json(users);
});

module.exports = {
    // ...
    getUsers,
}
```

<div data-node-type="callout">
<div data-node-type="callout-emoji">💡</div>
<div data-node-type="callout-text">Note: When you expose it to your route, ensure that you guard it using a validator. Examples of some validators are <code>Joi</code>, <code>Express Validator</code> etc.</div>
</div>

Now, when you want to use this on POSTMAN, this is how your query should look like.
